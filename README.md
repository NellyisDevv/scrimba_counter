# scrimba_counter

Following along with Scrimba and coding the lessons as I learn new things.

# Purpose?

I want to work on a project that I can see results on.
I am really enjoying odin project and feel like I'm
learning a ton, but I feel like I need to see something
actually happen on my screen for once and not just
console log logic.

# Main Goal

My main goal is to learn how to make this cool counter app.
And after I want to go back to Odin and make the Rock, Paper, Scissor game on my own!
