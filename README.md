# scrimba_counter

Following along with Scrimba and coding the lessons as I learn new things.

# Purpose?

I want to work on a project that I can see results on.
I am really enjoying odin project and feel like I'm
learning a ton, but I feel like I need to see something
actually happen on my screen for once and not just
console log logic.

# Main Goal

My main goal is to learn how to make this cool counter app.
And after I want to go back to Odin and make the Rock, Paper, Scissor game on my own!

# Added Features

One feature I added that is not part of the scrimba
counter is the ability to decrement the count. Also, I've
added the ability to hear sound when you click one of the
buttons!
